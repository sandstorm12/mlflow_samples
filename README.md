# Sample_mlflow

A sample project to act as a learning tool and a baseline for future mlflow-based AIML projects


## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

Run sample:

```bash
python3 mlflow_sample.py
```

Launch MLFlow UI:

# Launch on custom address and port
mlflow ui -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000
```


## Urgent issues and future work
1. Feature: Add custom model sample
2. Feature: Learn how to use experiments and runs
3. Refactor: Create a standard for model and artifact storage


## Issues and future work
1. *Nothing so far*
